RoadMap is a learning platform where students can get high-quality resources such as articles, videos, curated by educators, industry experts, and academic institutions to provide an organized learning experience from readily available resources. 

To promote engagement and collaboration, Roadmap assigns students to study groups with peers who are studying similar topics. Study groups have access to a shared virtual workspace where they can collaborate on assignments, discuss concepts, and provide feedback to each other..
